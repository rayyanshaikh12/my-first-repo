Using local workflow is simple:
* Initialize the working directories
* Modify your project
* Add the files to the staging area
* Commit your changes
* Using the remote workflow seems complicated but it is actually really easy:
* Add remote as origin
*	Modify your project
*	Add the files to the staging area
*	Commit your changes
*	Push the changes onto the remote
